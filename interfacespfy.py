"""

    This module makes the connection to the spotify WEB API to get information
    on the user music preferences. It is able to write csv files for playlists
    to be analyzed with future modules.

    The goal with this module is to make the spotify data available in a simple
    way for local analysis and interactive analysis with ipython or a jupyter
    notebook.

    This is an experimental project so the preferences are being saved in csv
    files but the music data should be saved in a database or not saved at
    all for privacy reasons.

    --- IMPORTANT ---
    All spotify objects in this module are dicts representing JSON objects defined
    in the Spotify WEB API @link: https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/object-model/
